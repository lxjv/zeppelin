I have a very strained relationship with UK politics.

Well, it's more a case of "the two main parties both want to deny trans people basic human rights and also they're both racist now but there's no point for voting anyone else since no-one else is going to vote for them"

Eh, maybe I'm jaded. heh, okay I am definitely jaded.

The UK politics scene is fucked and I'm scared.

I can't move anywhere since I am miserable at learning languages (my duolingo history will tell you that) so I am stuck on this island forever *yay*

anyway im going to go sleep good night

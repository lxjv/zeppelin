*(also known as "hey, I've **finally** found out who i want to be, but i didn't do it fast enough so now i'm screwed" :P)*

I feel too late to transition, which feels weird to say as I'm 16 as i'm writing this and I've seen people 30 years older than me transition.

But puberty has already taken its course and i just feel trapped inside this body.

I don't even have the time energy to think about this stuff most of the time, due to not having enough hours in the day and being too mentally and physically exhausted after school or anything else i have to do.

The NHS waiting times for anything related to transgender healthcare would make me suspend my whole life for up to five years just for a first appointment and I don't have the money for going private.

Will I forever be trapped in a body that can't fit me? I will find out eventually.

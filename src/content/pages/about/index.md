Hi! I'm Laker. I'm a student living in England.
I've been creative my entire life, but started writing to clear my head, about 3 years ago.

I came out as non-binary in 2018, and later revised that to trans woman in 2022.

I'm also Autistic. I'll probably write about that... eventually. (oh yeah, I've got ADHD too. that's why I have 50 drafted posts)

I listen to music essentially every waking second of the day. You can look at what I'm listening to over on [Last.fm](https://last.fm/user/lxjv)

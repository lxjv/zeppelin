		Hi! I'm <a class="u-url ntd" rel="me" href="{{author.url}}">Laker Turner</a> (<a href="https://laker.tech/pronouns" class="u-pronouns">she/her</a>). <br>

<p>
	I'm learning a mix of Rust, C, JS, and Python right now, but I'm probably going to stick with Rust. <br>
	On the web side, I like Eleventy (it's what builds this site!). <br> <br>
	When I'm not knee-deep in my terminal, I like making music, taking photographs <br>
	and reading <strong>Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</strong> for the 5th time.

<p>Feel free to walk around and see what's going on, here are my latest blog posts!</p>

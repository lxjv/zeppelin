<p>
	I'm learning a mix of Rust, C, JS, and Python right now, but I'm probably going to stick with Rust. <br>
	On the web side, I like Eleventy (it's what builds this site!). <br> <br>
	When I'm not knee-deep in my terminal, I like making music, taking photographs and reading
	<strong>Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</strong> for the 5th time.

        Hi! I'm <a class="u-url ntd" rel="me" href="{{author.url}}">Laker Turner</a>
        (<a href="https://laker.tech/pronouns" class="u-pronouns">she/her</a>). <br>

    I'm learning a mix of Rust and Java/Typescript right now, but I'm probably going to stick with Rust. <br>
    On the web side, I like Eleventy (it's what builds this site!). <br> <br>
    When I'm not knee-deep in my terminal, I like making music, taking photographs <br>
    and reading <strong>Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</strong> for the 5th time.

<p>Feel free to walk around and see what's going on, here are some blog posts!</p>

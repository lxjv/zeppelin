- As of the date listed above, I'm 18 years of age. Take that as you will.

- Most questions are allowed. They just have be in "good faith."
(Good, honest intentions, even if producing unfortunate results.)

- I take a quite liberal approach to swearing, so I'm sorry in advance if I offend you in anyway, I'm working on it.

- In that same vein, I'm a very sarcastic person.

- I don't mind jokes at my expense, I'll probably find them funny. <br>
Please don't respond on my behalf about them, as it causes a mess that I dont have the energy to clean up.

- In general, [Dont be an asshole](https://asshole.fyi), [Don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com) and [Feel free to fuck off](https://fuckoff.laker.tech).

I'm trying to use social media less right now, so i might not see your replies / messages. <br>
If you want to talk, [email me](/contact). Thanks :D

Please read [my social media greeting](/contact/greeting) before contacting me! Thank you in advance.

### Active
- Fediverse: [@la@social.lol](https://social.lol/@la) - This is my favourite social media platform / community. <3

### Lurking

### Ignoring / Deprecated

- Bluesky - [@laker.tech](https://bsky.app/profile/laker.tech) - I barely used Bluesky when I did use it, now I don't even login.

- Tumblr - [@lakerjv](https:lakerjv.tumblr.com) - I posted once? lakerjv is a sub-blog of my actual tumblr though.

### Deleted
- Twitter (TwiX): previously @lakerjv / @lakerjvt - I have no account on Twitter because of the current management.
- laker.gay: previously @la - This was my own fediverse server. I decided to delete it due to the UK's new "Online Safety Bill" ([link](https://social.lol/@la/111597722244578267))
- Tiktok - Ruined my attention span.

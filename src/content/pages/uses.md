### Hardware
#### Aestrea - Macbook Air 15'
{ Remind me to add a photo please! }
- specs: **16GB RAM, 1TB storage**
- accessories: Logi MX Master 3S

The thing I write this whole website on.

#### Cyrus - My desktop
{ I would take a photo, but both my room and cable management are terrible }
- specs: **Intel 8600K, GTX 1060 3gb, 16GB of RAM**
- OS: Arch Linux

Mostly just runs Syncthing right now.

#### Lovelace

{ imagine a rPI in a drawer }

It's a Raspberry Pi stuck in my living room bookcase.

I'm doing nothing with it right now, I should probably do something about that.

#### Non-Computer things

- Phone: iPhone 11, Red
- Watch: Apple Watch SE2
- E-reader: Kindle Paperwhite (whatever's the latest generation)

### Software

- I use VSCode as my main code editor, but I'm thinking about moving to Neovim or Emacs any minute now.
- I use the same fonts in my editors as I do on this site: Albert Sans for prose, and a NerdFont version of IBM Plex Mono, aggravatingly called ***BlexMono Nerd Font Mono***

- For email, I use Fastmail along with a few clients: [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org) on Cyrus, Apple Mail on Aestrea, and the Fastmail web app everywhere else.

### Other things
- I'm a huge fan of Field Notes notebooks and carry one in my jacket pocket everywhere I go.
- My wallet and keys are nothing special.
- I always carry a roll of Polo mints with me (not sponsored)

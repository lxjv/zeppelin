Hi! I'm Laker. I don't like talking about myself. This is going to be fun.

I'm a student living in England.
I've been creative my entire life, but started writing about 3 years ago.

I'm also learning how to program, and if any of it actually works I'll put it up on [GitHub](/git).

I first came out as non-binary in 2018, and [later as a trans woman in 2022](/out).

### About laker.tech

laker.tech is made with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), and deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

> I might start self-hosting it soon? No promises.

Everything was written by hand, using either Visual Studio Code or Neovim on either a MacBook Air, or my desktop.

The font you see everywhere is **Albert Sans** and code blocks use `IBM Plex Mono`.

The little tree guy in the favicon was drawn by [Momo](https://heyheymomo.com).

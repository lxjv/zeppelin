# Zeppelin - Concorde v4
A unified solution to a problem I often have:

> should this go into the blog or wiki?

Now, the wiki is the blog, and the blog is the wiki! and also my website. mostly.

## Setup for development
The only 2 outside dependencies are `just` and `gum` (for CLI)

```sh
npm i

# build
just build

# start server
just start

# clean-slate build and start server
just purge

# add zep.sh into your global path
just install-cli
```

# Zeppelin - Concorde v4

A unified solution to a problem I often have:

Now, the wiki is the blog, and the blog is the wiki! and also my website.

## Inspirations

- Arcade Wise (https://arcades.agency) - general structure
- Robb Knight (https://rknight.me) - the omg.lol community's local eleventy wizard

### Articles that helped me

## Ideas
- finally using sass? (sorry tailwind, but i like writing my own CSS xD)
